This is by no means a completed project!!!

The main idea is to create a site where the user can find whole Asterix comic collection. The website is going to be open to every visitor, but registration is necessary in order to do anything more than reading the comic books.
The whole project is on Laravel. I have used bootstrap for some basic design and MySQL as a database. I used Eloquent for the registration and authentication part.
